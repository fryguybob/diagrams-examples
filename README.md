Project to solve a 3d puzzle.  Diagrams projections and Rasterific's `gifMain` are used to
visualize the pieces.

Playing with 1.3 intersections, exploring what will be nice for an API that includes
intersection parameters.

`lion`
---------

Eventually will turn into a wall hanging made from felt squares.
